# üìä E-commerce Customer Behavior & Product Performance Analysis  
*(Data Analysis Apprenticeship Project ‚Äì The Look E-Commerce Dataset)*  

---

## üéØ Apprenticeship Alignment: Google Data Analytics  
This project is designed to align with the **Google Data Analytics Apprenticeship Job Description (JD)** by showcasing the required skills in:  

- SQL & BigQuery  
- Data cleaning & anomaly detection  
- Data visualization (Google Sheets)  
- Storytelling with data (Google Slides)  
- Business insights & recommendations  

**Goal:** Demonstrate **end-to-end data analysis** with real business value.

## üìå Project Overview  
Using the public **‚ÄúThe Look‚Äù E-commerce dataset** on BigQuery, this project analyzes customer behavior, product performance, and conversion funnels to deliver **actionable business insights**.  

### üîÑ Data Analysis Lifecycle  
1. **Data Collection & Assessment** ‚Äì Extracted data from BigQuery, checked anomalies (NULLs, duplicates, invalid dates, negatives).  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** ‚Äì Filtered out test transactions, $0 prices, duplicates.  
3. **Custom Analysis** ‚Äì SQL queries for KPIs, retention, cohorts, funnels, product performance.  
4. **Visualization & Storytelling** ‚Äì Google Sheets dashboards + Google Slides presentation.  
5. **Recommendations** ‚Äì Business-focused, data-driven actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **BigQuery (SQL)** ‚Äì Data extraction, cleaning, and analysis  
- **Google Sheets** ‚Äì Pivot tables, charts, dashboards  
- **Google Slides** ‚Äì Professional storytelling & presentation  
- **GitHub** *(optional)* ‚Äì Documentation & version control

## üìÇ Project Workflow  

### 1. üîç Data Assessment & Cleaning  
- Checked for **NULL values** in users, orders, products  
- Removed **duplicate orders**  
- Flagged anomalies (e.g., **negative sale prices, future-dated transactions**)  

### 2. üìà Business KPI Analysis  
- Monthly Revenue Growth  
- Orders Trend  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  
- Seasonal Sales Peaks  

### 3. üõí Product Performance & Pareto (80/20)  
- Ranked products by **revenue contribution**  
- Top **20% products = 80% of revenue**  
- Strategy recommendations:  
  - **Category A:** Top performers ‚Üí scale marketing & supply  
  - **Category C:** Long-tail ‚Üí bundling or discounting  

### 4. üë• Customer Retention & Cohort Analysis  
- Built cohort tables by **first purchase month**  
- Found **~35% retention** from Month 1 ‚Üí Month 2 (Jan 2022 cohort)  
- Recommended **post-purchase engagement campaigns**  

### 5. üîª Funnel Drop-off Analysis  
- Funnel: **View ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Purchase**  
- Identified **15% drop-off** at Add-to-Cart ‚Üí Purchase  
- Suggested **A/B testing, UX optimization, cart recovery emails**  

### 6. ‚úÖ Data Quality & Anomalies  
- Found **0.1% test data with $0 sale price**  
- Excluded anomalies ‚Üí ensured **data integrity**  

---

## üìä Key Insights  

- **Business KPIs:** Revenue & Orders rising steadily, stable AOV, seasonal peaks in **November**.  
- **Pareto Analysis:** Top **20% products drive ~80% of revenue**.  
- **Customer Cohorts:** 35% retention Month 1 ‚Üí Month 2 (Jan 2022).  
- **Funnel:** 10% View-to-Cart, 85% Cart-to-Buy ‚Üí bottleneck at **product page**.  
- **Data Quality:** Minimal anomalies; test data excluded.
